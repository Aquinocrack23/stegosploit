stegosploit
===========

I got really bored and wanted to fiddle with some JavaScript.
Some basic javascript combined with steganography.js by [Peter Eigenschink](https://github.com/petereigenschink) resulted in exploitable images.

Original exploit discovered by [Saumil Shah](https://twitter.com/therealsaumil) and used the HTML5 `<canvas>` element.
